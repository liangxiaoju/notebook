The coordinate-system is defined relative to the screen of the phone in its
default orientation. The axes are not swapped when the device's screen
orientation changes.

The X axis is horizontal and points to the right, the Y axis is vertical and
points up and the Z axis points towards the outside of the front face of the
screen. In this system, coordinates behind the screen have negative Z values.

Note:
This coordinate system is different from the one used in the
Android 2D APIs where the origin is in the top-left corner.
