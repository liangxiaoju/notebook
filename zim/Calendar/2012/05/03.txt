curses keeps two data structures representing the terminal screen:
a physical screen,describing what is actually on the screen,
and a virtual screen, describing what the programmer wants to have on the screen

wnoutrefresh: copies the named window to the virtual screen
doupdate: compares  the  virtual screen to the physical screen and does the actual update
touchwin: pretending that the entire window has been changed
